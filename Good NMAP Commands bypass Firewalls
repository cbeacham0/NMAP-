-sW -vv -p ((port#))
windows scan to bypass the firewall
The nmap -sW -vv -p command performs a TCP window scan. Let’s break it down:
-sW: Initiates a TCP window scan. This technique examines the TCP window size of open ports to infer their state (open, closed, or filtered).
-vv: Increases verbosity, providing more detailed output.
-p: Specifies the ports to scan. You can specify a single port or a range of ports

nmap --mtu 8 -vv (Input IP address)
The nmap --mtu 8 -vv command allows you to specify your own Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for the scan. Here’s what it does:

The MTU represents the maximum size of a packet that can be transmitted over a network. By using this option, Nmap creates fragmented packets with the specified size.
Smaller packets are transmitted instead of sending one complete packet at a time. This technique helps evade filtering and detection mechanisms enabled on the target machine.
In the example above, the argument --mtu 8 makes Nmap use small 8-byte packets for the scan

The nmap -f -vv -p command performs a TCP fragment scan. Let’s break it down:
-f: Initiates a TCP fragment scan. Nmap sends fragmented packets to the target, which can help evade firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS).
-vv: Increases verbosity, providing more detailed output.
-p: Specifies the ports to scan. You can specify a single port or a range of ports
